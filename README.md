# Project-1-Unix-Linux-Command-Line-Interpreter
A command-line interpreter was written in C to be compiled and run in a Linux terminal. It displays in the terminal that the user has switched over to the interpreter. Then based on what command the user enters the interpreter executes it and shows the results. The code is run using the gcc compiler, then the first thing that is processed is the users entered command, if the input is empty it will be sent to the system then the prompt will return, if the input is an actual command or value it will be broken into tokens separated by the delimetier space using the c function strtok(). A child is then made with the fork() command, in the terminal if a commands correct binary is found then the command will be executed, if not then the an error message will appear. 
A list of the current functioning commands are: 
ls : This command will list out all the files in the current directory.
ls -a : This command will list out all the files in the current directory, including the hidden ones.
id : This command will find the names of user, group names and numeric IDs.
pwd : This command will print out the full path of the current directory that the user is currently on.
cat : This command will print the content of a file.
exit : This command will exit the shell.
clear : This command will clear the shell of text.
echo : This command prints out arguments as standard output.
whoami : This command prints out the current userâ€™s name.
df: This command will show the user both th free and used disk space of the file system.

To compile and run:
1. Have the commandline.c code 
2. In the terminal: gcc commandline.c then ./a.out
3. Now the command line should be running
4. To create and run a batch:
5.  emacs (or other text editor) batch1.sh
6.  chmod +x batch1.sh
7.  ./batch1.sh
8.  To exit the program ctrl+c
